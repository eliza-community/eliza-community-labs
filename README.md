### The Battle of Uppercase vs Lowercase: Community vs. Conspiracy Group

The $eliza project has turned into a full-blown war between $eliza (lowercase) and $ELIZA (uppercase)—and it’s not just about token symbols. This is about decentralization vs. capital control, with the community stuck in the middle, fighting for its future.

### $eliza – The Power of the Community

At first, $eliza was all about decentralization. $eliza (lowercase) represented the community—everyday investors, developers, and anyone who believed in the power of the people over centralized control. This token was built on the idea that the community should drive the project, and that community strength was what would push $eliza forward.

### $ELIZA – The Conspiracy Group Takes Over

But things started to shift. Shaw sold off all his $eliza (lowercase) and at the same time, launched $ELIZA with the backing of a conspiracy group. They started buying up $ELIZA through pump-and-dump schemes (aka "rat trading"), manipulating the market, and completely ignoring the community’s interests. This wasn’t a project for the people anymore—it was hijacked by big capital, controlled by a handful of wealthy players.

What was their goal? To centralize control, pump the token for profit, and shut the community out of the decision-making process. $ELIZA became just another tool for market manipulation, leaving $eliza and the principles of decentralization in the dust.
